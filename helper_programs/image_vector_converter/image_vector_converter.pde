/*
. Program written to allow;
    (A) Manual creation of a vector list (e.g. Place ordered points by hand to provide a vector lines usable 
        by the vectrex; an image can be overlayed behind to essentially 'trace' it)
    (B) Automatic creation of a vector list from an image provided
. The generated vector list will be a set of relative vectors applicable to the 'lines(nlines, list)' function 
    declared in vectrex/bios.h, as provided by CMOC
. Another list will also be provided which specifies the indices in the vector list where the line should not be 
    drawn, just the beam moved (so the image does not have to completely connected)
