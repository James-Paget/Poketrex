# Poketrex
A Pokemon-style demo for the Vectrex, programmed in C with the use of CMOC.

# Build
The .bin file can be generated, once CMOC is installed (tested on CMOC version 0.1.97) with the command;
" cmoc --vectrex -I. -o POKETREX.bin poketrex_main.c "
Note as well that many of the headers seen in the 'vectrex_files' folder are provided directly from the 'cmoc/includes' directly provided on installation.

##  WILL NEED TO INCLUDE THE OTHER C FILES AS EXPANDS

# Running
This program has only been tested on the VIDE and ParaJVE vectrex emulators.

# Helper Programs
This repository also includes a helper program used to generate vector images from provided images. It can be run in Processing, where the supplied image to replicate must be placed in the the '/data' folder inside 'helper_programs'. The controls can be viewed inside the program or using the instructions when ran.
